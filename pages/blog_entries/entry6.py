# The Howey Test and Initial Coin Offerings

From: Anthony Rohloff  
To: Klein

## BLUF

The United States is falling behind in the race to embrace cryptocurrencies. The Howey Test,
while shown to be useful when applied to concepts like initial coin offerings, is not sufficiently
comprehensive to properly regulate the industry. Countries elsewhere in the world regulate crypto in a
fundamentally different way that allows ideas to prosper.

## Background

The Howey Test was established by *SEC v. W.J. Howey Co.* in 1946. The test uses four criteria to
determine if a transaction is considered as an investment contract:

1. There must be an investment of money.
2. The investment must be in a common enterprise.
3. There must be a reasonable expectation of profits.
4. Profits must come primarily from the efforts of others.

If the transaction passes all four criteria, the SEC has jurisdiction over regulations of the transaction.
The SEC has a clearly defined three-part mission on investor.gov: protect investors, maintain fair,
orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation. If a transaction can be regulated by
the SEC, the commission can subject parties involved to bans, fines, and criminal penalties.

Cryptocurrency has been on the rise since the inception of Bitcoin by Satoshi Nakamoto. The biggest
names in the space, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, are commonly classified as commodities and regulated
by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. However, these cryptocurrencies created a wide range
of new opportunities in finance that differ from how many people traditionally understand crypto.

One of these opportunities is initial coin offerings (ICOs). The idea is similar to an IPO, except that
instead of equity in a company, investors are sent tokens that may have utility on the platform being
created, such as access to features, services, or governance rights. Typically, a project publishes a
whitepaper, builds support, and then conducts the ICO. Investors transfer fiat or crypto and receive
tokens they can hold, sell, or exchange. The first ICO was conducted in 2013 under the name
Mastercoin. Shortly after, Ethereum launched via an ICO that raised over 31,000 BTC.

## Analysis

Over the years that followed, many successful ICOs backed exciting and useful projects. However,
there were also many failed, fraudulent, or outright scam ICOs that tainted the concept. These
challenges sparked SEC interest. Then-chairman Jay Clayton released an official statement on ICOs
in December 2017. In summary, the statement listed concerns related to ICOs and concluded they
should be treated as securities. He warned of weak investor protections and said many ICOs likely
fall under SEC jurisdiction under current law.

One early enforcement example was PlexCoin. The SEC reported in December 2017 that the seller
made fraudulent claims of an unrealistic 13-fold profit in less than a month. The SEC's Cyber Unit
obtained a court order to freeze all PlexCoin assets, preventing further financial damage and enabling
charges against those responsible.

## Recommendations

While there is an ever-growing body of regulatory law around cryptocurrencies, the United States is
not on the cutting edge of crypto regulation. Countries like Switzerland use a more modern and
encompassing approach that enables digital currencies to have more practical utility.

Unlike much of the world, Swiss frameworks often classify cryptocurrencies as assets rather than
securities, more akin to gold than stocks. This approach and wider public embrace enabled expanded
Bitcoin payment acceptance in certain places, local regulation allowing limited legal tender use, and
even the ability to pay some taxes in Bitcoin or Ethereum. The U.S. test derived from citrus field
disputes in the 1940s is causing the country to fall behind in a fast-changing field. Instead of forcing
reuse of old regulation, the U.S. needs modern legislation through Congress to enable full participation
in the world of cryptocurrencies.
