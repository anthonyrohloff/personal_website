# SleepyDuck Malware Article Review

The SleepyDuck remote access trojan (RAT) was a Windows malware that spread recently
via the OpenVSX marketplace through an extension called Solidity. The malware was able to
perform data exfiltration, drop differnent types of malicious payloads, and completely compromise
an infected machine. The articles “Malicious VSX Extension ‘SleepyDuck’ Uses Ethereum to Keep
Its Command Server Alive” by Ravie Lakshmanan and “New ‘SleepyDuck’ Malware in Open VSX
Marketplace Allow Attackers to Control Windows Systems Remotely” by Teamwin examine the
source, history, capabilites, consequences, and remediation methods of this malware.

This malware was originally spread by an extension called Solidity on the OpenVSX
marketplace. This marketplace is known as an unregulated alternative to the standard Visual Studio
Code Extension Marketplace. The extension was advertised as a legitimate Solidity extension,
which is a popular language for blockchain development, a technique known as name squatting. To
propagate this malware, the malicious actor allowed the extension to reach 14,000 downloads, then
pushed an update that embedded the SleepyDuck RAT into the source code of the extension. As
soon as the victims opened a new code editor window or any file with the “.sol” extension, the RAT
was activated.

This SleepyDuck implementation was capable of a wide variety of malicious actions, as is
true for most RAT’s. One of the functions noted by the articles was data exfiltration. The RAT was
capable of locating and uploading system information such as the hostname, username, MAC
address, and timezone. Additionally, since the malicious actor gained remote access to the
compromised machine and could download files to it, any malicious executable is possible. This
specific strain of the malware used an Ethereum remote procedure call (RPC) to connect to the
blockchain, initiate a contract with a remote server at sleepyduck.xyz, and then would be able to
receive commmands, files, and requests from that command-and-control server. This was especially
dangerous due to the fallback embedded in the malicious code. In the case that the domain was
seized or taken down, the malware would query a list of Ethereum RPC addresses and extract the
contract info that can hold the server details from it. It was a moving target that made the malware
hard to pin down and eliminate. In conjunction with the command-and-control server obfuscation,
the malware had sandbox evasion techniques written into its code. Solidity’s SleepyDuck strain was
a potent and complex malware with many malicious capabilites and evasion methods.

Once the fake Solidity extension reached 14,000 downloads, the malware authors likely
manipulated the download number to increase the extension’s popularity on the OpenVSX
marketplace. It is impossible to know how many more machines were affected past the original
14,000. The official download number reached upwards of 54,000 before being removed from the
marketplace. It was reported that one Russian developer lost greater than 500,000 dollars worth of
cryptocurrency due to SleepyDuck.

Teamwin recommended the following steps if a machine was infected by SleepyDuck:

1. Isolate the affected systems to prevent malware propagation across the device network.
2. Remove the dangerous extension from the infected machines.
3. Conduct a system scan using multiple anti-virus softwares.
4. Change any credentials stored on the device to prevent further damages.

They also suggested a number of ways to prevent infection from malware like SleepyDuck:
1. It is always responsible to verify the authenticity of any extension. Usually, popular
extensions are verified or available from more reliable sources than OpenVSX.
2. It is important to understand the permissions granted to an extension when using it. For
example, an extension that modifies the IDE theme should not need administrator
permissions.
3. Auditing downloaded extensions and removing ones that are no longer needed is best
practice, especially when the extension is downloaded from an untrustworthy source. The
way SleepyDuck propagated was completely hidden to most victims. They likely had no
idea what happened.
4. Endpoint detection and response (EDR) should be implemented on all workstations to
prevent a complete collapse in the event of one machine becoming contaminated. EDR can
isolate an infected machine and attempt to destroy the malware before it propagates to other
machines on the network.
5. Network monitoring is a great way to find connections to command-and-control servers.
Identify any unknown IP addresses and block ones that are not required.
6. Training developers on security risks such as untrustworthy IDE extensions is a great
preventative measure for companies to take.
7. Limiting permissions on workstations can turn dangerous RAT’s like SleepyDuck into
useless extensions that get uninstalled harmlessly.
8. Isolating the development environment from the production environment can prevent
customer outages when trying out new extensions in the development process.

In conclusion, SleepyDuck’s sneaky integration into the fake Solidity extension hosted on
the third-party VSCode extension marketplace called OpenVSX caused immense damages for
blockchain developers. Its intelligent use of Ethereum remote procedure calls helped to elude
domain seizures, while its sandbox evasion code made it tough to spot. The articles referenced gave
a strong technical description of the RAT, and gave steps to stop the bleeding caused by it. Finally,
recommendations were given to prevent similar attacks from suceeding in the future.
