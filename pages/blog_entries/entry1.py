# The Impending Impact of Quantum Computing on Encryption Algorithms

Our fastest supercomputers take thousands of years to solve certain complex and challenging problems. Quantum computers can solve these problems in minutes. Quantum computing ranging from hardware to algorithms is on the bleeding edge of computation. This is achieved by utilizing quantum mechanics to operate using ‘qubits’ as opposed to binary bits that traditional computational machines use. Even our most advanced encryption algorithms are susceptible to quantum computing. As this new technology becomes more accessible major changes will need to be made in the way information is encrypted and distributed.

Qubits are created by the manipulation of photons electrons trapped ions and more. They differ from binary bits because while a binary bit can only represent a 0 or a 1 a qubit can represent any value between and including 0 and 1 in the form of a wave. Qubits can also be superimposed allowing them to store an exponentially expanding amount of information. According to Schneider and Smalley “Two qubits can store four bits of information three can store eight and four can store twelve.” This ability allows quantum algorithms to work in a way that is impossible for classical computers which threatens our current standard encryption algorithms.

Many of the algorithms that are commonly used today such as RSA ECC and AES rely on factoring large prime numbers. These algorithms are incredibly safe from classical computers due to the limitations of binary bits. Quantum computers excel at these types of calculations because they can process a huge amount of data in comparison to classical computational methods. An example noted in “What is a Qubit?” by Schneider and Smalley likens these types of problems to a maze that a computer must solve. A classical computer will try every path until the exit is found while a quantum computer will look at the maze from above decide the paths that are most likely to lead to an exit and test those until the exit is found. As strides continue to be made in the field of quantum computing it is essential to find ways to store data securely that are impenetrable to this new threat.

Fortunately there are solutions being developed to prepare for this inevitability. A six-year competition was held by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to design an algorithm that can resist the abilities of a quantum computer. There were four winners selected for the standard and four more under consideration. The winners include one algorithm for general encryption: the CRYSTALS-Kyber algorithm and three for digital signatures: the CRYSTALS-Dilithium FALCON and SPHINCS+ algorithms. All but the SPHINCS+ algorithm uses structured lattices a type of math problem that both quantum and classical computers struggle with while the SPHINCS+ algorithm uses hash functions or one-way cryptographic functions. Cryptographically relevant quantum computers do not yet exist but NIST knows it must be prepared for that day.

Quantum computing and its ability to use qubits to crack the current standard encryption algorithms is a looming threat to the security of confidential information. The research and development of ever-stronger quantum computers shows the ability of these machines to perform calculations at unprecedented speeds by utilizing the superposition of elementary particles to create bits that can hold values other than 0 and 1. This issue has been extensively investigated and resulted in an output of standard algorithms that can stump the strongest computers of each type classical and quantum. Much work remains in implementing these protections as quantum computing becomes more accessible but there is time to achieve the necessary security level before the critical point emerges.
